1D CNN and LSTM Folder 
This folder Contains one .xlsx file of dataset which is used for testing and training 
one jupiter source file which shows implementation of 1D-CNN and one step LSTM using rain_tot_mm and water level as target
MultiVariate_LSTM Folder
This folder contains two .xlsx files of dataset which is used for training and testing
two jupiter notebook source files which shows implementation of Multivariate LSTM using rain_tot_mm and water level as target
Define two variables with nam eas n_step_in and step_out.n_step_in could represent the number of past time steps used as input to the model, and n_steps_out could represent the number of future time steps the model predicts.
i have used 60 past samples to predict 30 future samples.
